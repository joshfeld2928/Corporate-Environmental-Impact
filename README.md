# Corporate Environmental Impact Project
This program goes through my analysis of a file on company financial and ESG related data. There is one part at the end that gives users the opportunity to input the amount of assets of a company to predict that company's pollution. I also go through exploratory and statistical analysis, in addidtion to performing a hypothesis test and a ML algorithm. 

The attached csv file is the dataset I started with.
