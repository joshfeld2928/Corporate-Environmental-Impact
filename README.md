# Corporate Environmental Impact Project
This program goes through my analysis of a file on company financial, and ESG related data. There is one part at the end that gives users the opportunity to input an amount of emissions to see if a company would be predicted to be a polluter based on that number. I also go through exploratory and statistical analysis, in addidtion to performing a hypothesis test. 

The attached csv file is the dataset I started with.
